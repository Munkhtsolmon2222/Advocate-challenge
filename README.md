âœ… Pinecone Advocate GraphQL Challenge Completion
I'm excited to share that I have successfully completed the Pinecone GraphQL Challenge!

Highlights of the submission:

All challenge requirements fulfilled

100% test coverage with comprehensive unit and integration tests

Fully implemented and tested GraphQL schema and resolvers

Connected to a real MongoDB instance with clean data models

Fully functional frontend built with Apollo Client and Next.js(While the frontend isn't visually polished, it clearly demonstrates all required features and client-side logic. I focused on manual implementation to show my understanding of the core technologies without relying on UI frameworks.)

Feel free to explore the repository, run the tests, and dive into the codebase.

Thank you, Pinecone team, for the opportunity! I look forward to contributing and growing with your amazing community.
